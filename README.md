# toolsup
a silly little tool that installs a bunch of useful developer tools, ide(s), utilities, databases, programming languages, libraries and a few vcs(s) ðŸ˜Ž

# installation
only works on debian btw, it uses apt-get.

install `toolsup.sh`
then run `./toolsup.sh` to run it.

if it does not work, make sure it is executable (`chmod +x ./toolsup.xh`)
